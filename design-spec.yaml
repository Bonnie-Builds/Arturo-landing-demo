      The design uses a stark dark mode foundation to project power and modernity. 
      The core visual hook is the integration of small, inline graphics within 
      large-scale typography, suggesting seamless integration (a perfect metaphor for Arturo's AI). 
      Layouts are single-column focused, guiding the user linearly through the narrative 
      with rhythmic interruptions of scrolling marquees.

    title: "Isometric Kinetic Command Grid"
    prompt: |
      Cinematic wide shot of an infinite isometric grid floor fading into deep void black (#050505). The grid lines are razor-thin, matte dark grey (#222222), creating a sense of vast digital space. In the center, a subtle, volumetric fog glow in bio-lume lime green (#C7FF69) rises softly, illuminating the grid lines near the center with a phosphorescent energy. The lighting is internal and moody, feeling like a stealth server room. No floating objects, just the pristine, surgical grid environment. 8k resolution, unreal engine 5 render style, minimal, matte black materials.

    title: "Digital Data Stream Texture"
    prompt: |
      Full frame abstract texture of digital noise and subtle data streams. A deep obsidian black background (#050505) with extremely faint, fine-grain noise. Overlaid are cascading vertical streaks of code-like rain, but very abstract and blurred, in dark grey (#1F1F1F) and very faint traces of lime green (#C7FF69). The texture should feel like 'intelligent static' or a dormant supercomputer screen. Minimal contrast, matte finish, suitable for use as a subtle website section background.

  - id: "ui-workflow-builder"
    title: "Arturo Agent Workflow Interface"
    prompt: |
      High-fidelity UI mockup of a dark-mode node-based workflow editor. Orthographic view. The interface background is deep charcoal (#1F1F1F) with a subtle dot grid. Three main cards (nodes) are connected by smooth curved bezier lines. Left node: "Trigger: Email". Center node: "AI Processing" (glowing with a lime green #C7FF69 border and inner pulse). Right node: "Action: CRM Update". The nodes are sleek, matte black panels with white text and small icon indicators. The connecting lines are animated with a small light pulse moving left to right. The overall aesthetic is 'Hacker-Chic Enterprise'—clean, surgical, and high-contrast.

  - id: "ui-analytics-dashboard"
    title: "Terminal Analytics Command Center"
    prompt: |
      A futuristic analytics dashboard focusing on data density. Dark mode interface on a void black background. Features sharp, high-contrast line charts in bio-lume green (#C7FF69) plotting efficiency metrics. To the side, a 'terminal' log window displays scrolling text logs in a monospace font (Greeking/simulated text), glowing slightly like an old CRT monitor but with 4K sharpness. Numbers are large, white, and crisp. The layout is modular, grid-based, and utilitarian. No decorative fluff, just raw data visualization.

  - id: "concept-chaos"
    title: "Abstract Entangled Chaos"
    prompt: |
      Abstract 3D composition representing 'Manual Work Chaos'. A dense, tangled knot of dark grey wires, crumpled papers, and chaotic geometric shapes floating in a void. The materials are matte, non-reflective, and feel heavy or burdened. The lighting is dim, uneven, and shadowy, creating a sense of confusion and blockage. No green accents—just shades of grey and black. It looks like a systemic blockage or a 'Gordian knot' of bureaucracy. Cinematic lighting, 8k, unreal engine 5 render style.

  - id: "concept-order"
    title: "Abstract Aligned Precision"
    prompt: |
      Abstract 3D composition representing 'Automated Order'. The chaotic wires from the previous image have been straightened and transformed into perfectly parallel, glowing beams of light. Vertical and horizontal lines interact in a perfect 3D grid structure. The beams are bright bio-lume green (#C7FF69) and signal white, cutting through the darkness with laser precision. Floating sorted data blocks move along these rails. The composition represents flow, speed, and zero friction. Cinematic lighting, 8k, unreal engine 5 render style.
